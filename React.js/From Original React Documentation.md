# React — Learning Curve (based on react.dev)

Goal: Follow a progressive plan that maps to the official React docs at react.dev.

## Quick start

- Overview / Learn hub: https://react.dev/learn
- Official tutorial: https://react.dev/tutorial

## Week 1 — Core concepts (Get comfortable)

1. Introducing JSX — https://react.dev/learn/introducing-jsx
2. Rendering Elements — https://react.dev/learn/rendering-elements
3. Components & Props — https://react.dev/learn/components-and-props
4. State & Lifecycle — https://react.dev/learn/state-and-lifecycle
5. Handling Events — https://react.dev/learn/handling-events

## Week 2 — Component patterns & composition

1. Lists & Keys — https://react.dev/learn/lists-and-keys
2. Conditional Rendering — https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering
3. Lifting State Up — https://react.dev/learn/lifting-state-up
4. Composition vs Inheritance — https://react.dev/learn/composition-vs-inheritance

## Week 3 — Hooks (primary modern API)

1. Hooks intro — https://react.dev/learn/hooks-intro
2. State Hook (useState) — https://react.dev/learn/state-hook
3. Effect Hook (useEffect) — https://react.dev/learn/effect-hook
4. Custom Hooks — https://react.dev/learn/custom-hooks
5. Context + useContext — https://react.dev/learn/context

## Week 4 — Advanced & ecosystem

1. Optimizing Performance — https://react.dev/learn/optimizing-performance
2. Concurrent features & transitions — https://react.dev/learn/concurrent-ui (overview)
3. Testing React apps — https://react.dev/learn/testing
4. TypeScript with React — https://react.dev/learn/typescript

## Week 5 — Tooling, deployment & patterns

1. Router & client navigation (react-router docs) — https://reactrouter.com/
2. Build & deployment (Vite/CRA/Next) — see chosen framework docs
3. Accessibility — https://react.dev/accessibility

## Reference & API

- React reference: https://react.dev/reference/react
- Hooks reference: https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks

## Practice tasks (apply while learning)

- Build the tutorial app (tic-tac-toe)
- Create a small CRUD app (use state & effects)
- Convert a class component to hooks
- Add tests for components and hooks

## Notes

- Start small, practice components + state for a week before moving heavily into hooks/optimizations.
- Use the official Learn hub as the canonical sequence: https://react.dev/learn
