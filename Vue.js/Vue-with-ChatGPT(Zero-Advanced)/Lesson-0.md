# VueJS - Zero to Advanced Learning Path

## Lesson 0 — Introduction to Vue.js and Setting Up the Environment

### What is Vue.js?

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use as much or as little of it as you need. Vue.js focuses on the view layer and can be easily integrated with other libraries or existing projects.
Vue.js is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and performance. It provides a reactive data-binding system and a component-based architecture that makes it easy to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

### Setting Up the Environment

To start working with Vue.js, you need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps to get started:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Vue.js requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Install Vue CLI**: Vue CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps you create and manage Vue.js projects. You can install it globally using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @vue/cli
   ```

3. **Create a New Vue Project**: You can create a new Vue.js project using the Vue CLI by running the following command:

   ```bash
   vue create my-vue-app
   ```

   Replace `my-vue-app` with your desired project name. Follow the prompts to select the features you want to include in your project.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-vue-app
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server to see your Vue.js application in action:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

   This will start a local server, and you can access your application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

6. **Open the Project in Your Code Editor**: Open your project folder in your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code) to start building your Vue.js application.
